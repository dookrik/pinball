Reflection on the final game

1
Good idea but needs to be developed as it seems a bit aimless. Made the walls higher and added a light to give more visibility. Fixed the camera angle as well as the positioning of the maps’ graphic.

2
Needs to be developed further, no goals or scores, the visibility of the cats is off, the movement is jagged and glitchy(for the cats), missing mechanics, fixed the respawn. Fixed the end game zones to fix potential bugs.

3 fixed the cats so that they move properly, added sound onto my ball to simulate car noises added two separate scores, on for evil deeds, one for careful shopping… The stores are now reactive to the ball, the cats make more sounds and slightly wiggle so they feel organic. Instructions were added.


Final game:
I like where I got in my game, it is fun and quirky the sounds make for a fun collectable feature while the store don't provide much satisfaction. It can definitely be developed to maybe have more levels… There are scripts that I wanted to implement but could not find a way to get them to work  like the cats having nine lives each until dying?
